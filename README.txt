Kurukuru Kururin Super Speed Patch v1.0, by Blizihguh (https://udonge.reisen/)
Thanks to the GBA Dev community for resources and advice (https://github.com/gbadev-org/awesome-gbadev)

INSTALLATION:
Apply bps patch to an unpatched European ROM (CRC32: C4DAB956 / MD5: 48F3BC6BF59C34F057BD98B29FD7B848).
If you don't know how to apply a bps patch, I recommend using beat (https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/893/).
Alternatively, Marc Robledo has a browser-based tool to do it (https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/).

CONTROLS:
Hold L or R to make your paddle spin faster. Hold them both simultaneously to make it spin really fast.

KNOWN ISSUE:
This patch breaks the tutorial stages. They're still playable, however, you have to wait for the ghost to die before your paddle will spin. The rest of the game should play fine.

CHANGELOG:
v1.0: Initial release.
